<h1>ABOUT STEPHEN</h1>

<p>My name is Stephen Nisbet and I am a first year Master's Student at the University of Michigan studying User Experience and Human-Computer Interaction. To me, studying User Experience isn't just about technology and how to use it; it's about understanding the human condition and making technology accessible for those who need it. Prior to coming to the University of Michigan, I was an English major at Michigan State University, forging my interest in people, their stories, and the circumstances that influence their choices.</p>
